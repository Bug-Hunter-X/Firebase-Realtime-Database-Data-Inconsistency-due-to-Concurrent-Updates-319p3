In a Firebase project, data inconsistency might arise if multiple clients simultaneously update the same data without proper synchronization mechanisms. For instance, imagine two users trying to increment a counter in a Realtime Database node. Without transactions or optimistic locking, the final value might not accurately reflect the sum of individual increments, leading to unexpected behavior.  Here's an example using JavaScript:

```javascript
// Incorrect approach (race condition)
firebase.database().ref('counter').once('value', (snapshot) => {
  let count = snapshot.val() || 0;
  count++;
  firebase.database().ref('counter').set(count);
});

// Another client does the same thing simultaneously, leading to data loss.
```
